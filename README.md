    - Remove "open" class when loading single image views
    - When clicking on an album poster, the bg doesn't set on iphone/ipad (same url formatting issue as a couple days ago)
    - Add home icon to social icons
    - Consider making photo collection stop before nav so there's no scroll-behind
    - closing out of single view should reflect the album url...make sure all urls are gtg
